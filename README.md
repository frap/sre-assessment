# Assessment

## The application
This repository contains a frontend and a backend service. These services together serve as a ToDo List App.
Read the below documentation for details about each service.

[FrontEnd Readme](Frontend/README.md)

[Backend Readme](Backend/TodoList.Api/README.md)

## Pre Requisites
As this assessement came from a Github repo and had an exisiting docker-compose file for testing then in the spirit of not over engineering a solution the prequisite for the CI/CD solution are a Github account, Docker Desktop installed locally (only Docker desktop has docker compose has ECS intergration :( )  for local testing, and to have a simple cloud solution to also have credentials for a valid AWS account.
This proposed solution uses Github Actions to test the apps whilst under the develop branch. Once a pull request has been raised to merge the develop branch to main then docker-compose AWS ECS integration will be used again with github actions to deploy/re-deploy the application.

## Highlevel overview
All development is done under the develop branch of this repo. When you want to run the tests for the Frontend or Backend apps then _tag the commit_ with a semantic version number and the CI/CD flow will run the tests. When you want to deploy to the cloud then run a pull requests and when it is merged to main the Github action will deploy to AWS.
The solution uses basic AWS ECS as it is a basic app and Kubernetes would be an overkill.
we can get scale out by having multiple forntends behind an AWS load-balancer. 

## Process Instructions

### Local docker devlopment and testing
- clone the repo
- checkout the develop branch `git checkout -b develop` 
- code your changes.
- if you have local docker development environment then you can run the code locally via `docker compose up --detach`
- if you wish to run the dotnet or npm test then you can tag the devlopment branch with a semantic tag aka '1.0.1' `git tag 1.0.1` and then push to origin `git push origin --tags`
- when you want to deploy to the cloud raise a pull-request to merge to main

### Cloud deploy privileges from main
You will need an AWS account with IAM privileges 
- create docker ecs aws context `docker context create ecs ecs-context` (if you have Docker Desktop or linux version of docker)
- store your AWS credentials ( `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` ) in `$HOME/.aws/credentials`.
- Store your aws config (aka REgion ANd ECR Repository) in `$HOME/.aws/config` (`AWS_REGION` `ECR_REPOSITORY`)
- once pull-request is approved and merged it will be deployed to the cloud with the AWS docker-compose 

## Additional Comments

### Testing

I used act to test the github actions locally. As you can see there was a TDD "error" so my test flows wont complete. I didnt fix the TDD "error" as thought was aprt of process?
